# App Shack Android Refactoring Assignment

### Description
In this repository you will find a simple Android application containing two views. A list view that fetches some data from the network and displays it, and a details view that will display some more specific information about entities that are interacted with.

Your assignment is to refactor the Android project into something that _**you feel**_ is a more modern approach and is something that you would feel like working with in the future. _**Any changes are welcome**_, be them to design, architecture, language or otherwise. We encourage you to use standardized Android conventions and to build something that has maintainability, scalability and testability in mind.

We would like to mention that _**we do not**_ evaluate speed of delivery, although we would like to see some results within four weeks so that we could continue with the evaluation process.

Good luck, and have fun!
